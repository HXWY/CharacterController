# CharacterController
My goal is to create a *good* character controller for a semi-open world game.

The controller should:
1) Have smooth movement
2) Be able to traverse stairs and inclines smoothly
3) Use the new input system
4) Be able to jump across gaps
5) Be able to jump up and down
6) Be able to crawl
7) Be able to climb ladder-like things.
8) Use the sword, shield and bow for combat.
9) Convincingly interact with NPC's and the environment.
